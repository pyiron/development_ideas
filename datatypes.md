# Data types

- Data types are used not only to indicate the numerical types, but also the ontological types.
- Users have a possibility to indicate the following information in the data types:
  - Numericla data type (`float`, `int` etc.)
  - Ontological type (optional) [^1]
  - Units (optional)
  - Shape (optional)
- Data types can be applied to functions and data classes
- If applied to the functions, users have the possibility to apply an interpreter, which checks the compatibility of the input data and the output data. [^1]
- Users can define ontological types based on existing an ontological database [^1]

[^1]: (Sam) I wrote these points to initiate a discussion, but in reality I don't really know how the actual implementation should look.
