# Data classes
As generic interface to connect functions. To have the same interface for different simulation codes, it would be great to have the same functions with the same input arguments available for different simulation codes. But rather than having a large list of input arguments, it's preferable to use data classes. At the moment these data classes are scattered around in different modules, so it would be great to unify them in one location: https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_base/blob/main/pyiron_base/dataclasses/job.py , pyiron/pyiron_atomistics#1571 and https://github.com/pyiron-dev/pyiron-hdf5-format/tree/main/pyiron_io/dataclasses
