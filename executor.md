# Executor
The executor takes a task, assigns it to the available computing resources and returns a `concurrent.future.Future` object. This interface is defined in the python standard library. It is important to distinguish tasks and nodes in the context of a workflow graph. The execution of multiple nodes can be bundled into one task when they have similar resource requirements. In the same way a node can potentially create multiple tasks with different resource requirements. executorlib extends this interface in two ways: 1. It enables the assignment of resources beyond just the number of cores / threads. This is primarily achieved by interfacing with queuing systems like flux or SLURM. 2. It introduces dependent tasks, so when a task receives the future object of a previous task, then the task is only scheduled for execution ones the future object is done.
