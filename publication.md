# Publication of Scientific Data
A scientist who used pyiron to calculate material properties using standardized simulation protocols wants to publish the results of these calculation. Ideally, there should be no difference in the publishing process no matter if the scientist used `pyiron_base` or `pyiron_workflow`.

Potential platforms users from the (atomistic) community might be interested to use:
* https://zenodo.org
* A local installation of https://ckan.org
* A local installation of https://openbis.ch - primarily to share simulation results with collaborators
* https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/nomad-oasis.html
* https://www.aiidalab.net
