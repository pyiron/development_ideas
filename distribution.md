# Distribution of Functions 
* Scientific functions should be contributed from researchers worldwide.
* The researchers should be able to publish their scientific functions as independent software package, for example by releasing it on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org) and writing a paper for the [journal of open source software](https://joss.theoj.org).
* The wrapper to maximize the utility in the pyiron context should be minimal.
* pyiron should be capable to track and ideally synchronize the functions which are available on different computing systems.
